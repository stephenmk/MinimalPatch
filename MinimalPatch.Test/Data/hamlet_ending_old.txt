Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassador, with Drumme,
Colours, and Attendants.

Fortin.
Where is this sight?

Hor.
What is it ye would see;
If ought of woe, or wonder, cease your search.

For.
His quarry cries on hauocke. Oh proud death,
What feast is toward in thine eternall Cell.
That thou so many Princes, at a shoote,
So bloodily hast strooke.

Amb.
The sight is dismall,
And our affaires from England come too late,
The eares are senselesse that should giue vs hearing,
To tell him his command'ment is fulfill'd,
​That Rosincrance and Guildensterne are dead:
Where should we haue our thankes?

Hor.
Not from his mouth,
Had it th'abilitie of life to thanke you:
He neuer gaue command'ment for their death.
But since so iumpe vpon this bloodie question,
You from the Polake warres, and you from England
Are heere arriued. Giue order that these bodies
High on a stage be placed to the view,
And let me spcake to th'yet vnknowing world,
How these things came about. So shall you heare
Of carnall, bloudie, and vnnaturall acts,
Of accidentall iudgements, casuall slaughters
Of death's put on by cunning, and forc'd cause,
And in this vp shot, purposes mistooke,
Falne on the Inuentors heads. All this can I
Truly deliuer.

For.
Let vs hast to heare it,
And call the Noblest to the Audience.
For me, with sorrow, I embrace my Fortune,
I haue some Rites of memory in this Kingdome,
Which are ro claime, my vantage doth
Inuite me,

Hor.
Of that I shall haue alwayes cause to speake,
And from his mouth
Whose voyce will draw on more:
But let this same be presently perform'd,
Euen whiles mens mindes are wilde,
Lest more mischance
On plots, and errors happen.

For.
Let foure Captaines
Beare Hamlet like a Soldier to the stage,
For he was likely, had he beene put on
To haue prou'd most royally:
And for his passage,
The Souldiours Musicke, and the rites of Warre
Speake lowdly for him.
Take vp the body; Such a fight as this
Becomes the field, but heere shewes much amis.
Go, bid the Souldiers shoote.

Exeunt Marching: after the which, a Peale of
Ordenance are shot off.
